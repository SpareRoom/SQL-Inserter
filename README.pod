=head1 NAME

SQL::Inserter - Efficient buffered DBI inserter and fast INSERT SQL builder

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SQL::Inserter;

  my $sql = SQL::Inserter->new(
    dbh    => $dbh,
    table  => 'table',
    cols   => [qw/col1 col2.../],
    buffer => 100?   # Default buffer is 100 rows
  );

  # Fastest method: pass single or multiple rows of data as an array
  $sql->insert($col1_row1, $col2_row1, $col1_row2...);

  # You can manually flush the buffer at any time with no argument on insert
  # (otherwise there is auto-flush on the object's destruction)
  $sql->insert();

  # Alternative, pass a single row as a hash, allows SQL code passed as
  # references instead of values (no need to define cols in constructor)
  $sql->insert({
    column1 => $data1,
    column2 => \'NOW()',
    ...
  });

  # There are also functions to just get the SQL statement and its bind vars
  # similar to SQL::Abstract or SQL::Maker insert, but with much less overhead:
  my ($sql, @bind) = simple_insert($table, {col1=>$val...});

  # Multi-row variant:
  my ($sql, @bind) = simple_insert($table, [{col1=>$val1...},{col1=>$val2...},...]);

  # Or, construct an SQL statement with placeholders for a given number of rows:
  my $sql = multi_insert_sql('table', [qw/col1 col2.../], $num_of_rows);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SQL::Inserter's main lightweight OO interface will let you do L<DBI> inserts as
efficiently as possible by managing a multi-row buffer and prepared statements.

You only have to select the number of rows for the buffered writes (default is 100)
and choose whether to pass your data in arrays (fastest, requires all data to be bind
values, will execute the same prepared statement every time the buffer is full) or
hashes (allows SQL code apart from plain values).

It also provides lightweight functions that return the SQL queries to be used manually,
similar to C<SQL::Abstract::insert>, but much faster.

C<INSERT IGNORE> and C<ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE> variants supported for MySQL/MariaDB.

Although it is developed for use in our production MySQL/MariaDB, its main functions
will work on DBs with similar C<INSERT INTO> multi-row syntax like PostgreSQL.
From v0.03, Oracle Database is also supported.

=head1 EXPORTS

On request: C<simple_insert> C<multi_insert_sql>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 C<new>

  my $sql = SQL::Inserter->new(
    dbh        => $dbh,
    table      => $table,
    cols       => \@column_names?,
    buffer     => 100?,
    duplicates => $ignore_or_update?,
    null_undef => $convert_undef_to_NULL?,
    oracle     => $oracle_format?
  );

Creates an object to insert data to a specific table. Buffering is enabled by default
and anything left on it will be written when the object falls out of scope / is destroyed.

Required parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<dbh> : A L<DBI> database handle.

=item * C<table> : The name of the db table to insert to. See L</"NOTES"> if you
are using a restricted word for a table name.

=back

Optional parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<cols> : The names of the columns to insert. It is required if arrays are
used to pass the data. With hashes they are optional (the order will be followed
if they are defined). See L</"NOTES"> if you are using any restricted words for
column names.

=item * C<buffer> : Max number of rows to be held in buffer before there is a write.
The buffer flushes (writes contents) when the object is destroyed. Setting it to 1
writes each row separately (least efficient). For small rows you can set buffer to
thousands. The default is a (conservative) 100 which works with big data rows.

=item * C<duplicates> : For MySQL, define as C<'ignore'> or C<'update'> to get an
C<INSERT IGNORE> or C<ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE> query respectively. See L</"NOTES">
for details on the latter.

=item * C<null_undef> : Applies to the hash inserts only. If true, any undefined
values will be converted to SQL's C<NULL> (similar to the C<SQL::Abstract> default).
The default behaviour will leave an undef as the bind variable, which may either
create an empty string in the db or give an error depending on your column type and
db settings.

=item * C<oracle> : This is automatically set to true when an Oracle driver is
detected (using C<$dbh-E<gt>{Driver}-E<gt>{Name}>) and the module will produce the
Oracle C<INSERT ALL> format. Specifying it manually in the constructor will override
the automatic detection - a false value will force the MySQL compatible multi-row
C<INSERT INTO> syntax (which should work on Oracle 23c or newer), while a true value
will generate the "classic" Oracle syntax even without an Oracle driver detected.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 insert

  # Fastest array method. Only bind data is passed.
  my $ret = $sql->insert(@column_data_array);

  # Alternative allows SQL code as values in addition to bind variables.
  my $ret = $sql->insert(\%row_data);

  # No parameters will force emptying of buffer (db write).
  my $ret = $sql->insert();

The main insert method. Returns the return value of the last C<execute> statement
if there was one called, 0 otherwise (buffer not full.

It works in two main modes, by passing an array or a hashref:

=over 4

=item Array mode

Pass the data for one or more rows in a flat array, buffering will work automatically
based on your C<buffer> settings. Obviously your C<@column_data_array> has to contain
a multiple of the number of C<cols> defined on the constructor.

This is the fastest mode, but it only allows simple bind values. Any undefined values
will be passed directly to DBI->execute, which may or may not be what you expect -
there will not be any explicit conversion to SQL C<NULL>.

=item Hash mode

Pass a reference to a hash containing the column names & values for a single row
of data. If C<cols> was not defined on the constructor, the columns from the first
data row will be used instead. For subsequent rows any extra columns will be disregarded
and any missing columns will be considered to have an C<undef> (which can be
automatically converted to C<NULL> if the C<null_undef> option was set).

=item Flushing the buffer

Calling C<insert> with no arguments forces a write to the db, flushing the buffer.
You don't have to call this manually as the buffer will be flushed when the object
is destroyed (e.g. your object falls out of scope).

=item Mixing modes

You can theoretically mix modes, but only when the buffer is empty e.g. you can start
with the array mode, flush the buffer and continue with hash mode (C<cols> will be
defined from the array mode). Or you can start with hash mode (so C<cols> will be defined
from the very first hash), and after flushing the buffer you can switch to array mode.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<last_retval>

  my $val = $sql->{last_retval}

The return value of the last DBI C<execute()> is stored in this attribute. On a successful
insert it should contain the number of rows of that statement. Note that an C<insert>
call, depending on the buffering, may call C<execute()> zero, one or more times.

=head2 C<row_total>

  my $total = $sql->{row_total}

Basically a running total of the return values, for successful inserts it shows you
how many rows were inserted into the database. It will be undef if no C<execute()> has
been called.

=head2 C<buffer_counter>

  my $count = $sql->{buffer_counter}

Check how many un-inserted data rows the buffer currently holds.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 simple_insert

  # Single row
  my ($sql, @bind) = simple_insert($table, \%fieldvals, \%options);

  # Multi-row
  my ($sql, @bind) = simple_insert($table, [\%fieldvals_row1,...], \%options);

Returns the SQL statement and bind variable array for a hash containing the row
columns and values. Values are treated as bind variables unless they are references
to SQL code strings. E.g. :

  my ($sql, @bind) = simple_insert('table', {foo=>"bar",when=>\"NOW()"});
  ### INSERT INTO table (foo, when) VALUES (?,NOW())

The function also accepts an array of hashes to allow multi-row inserts:

  my ($sql, @bind) = simple_insert('table', [{foo=>"foo"},{foo=>"bar"}]);
  ### INSERT INTO table (foo) VALUES (?),(?)

The first row (element in array) needs to contain the superset of all the columns
that you want to insert, if some of your rows have undefined column data.

Options:

=over 4
 
=item * C<null_undef> : If true, any undefined values will be converted to SQL's
C<NULL> (similar to the C<SQL::Abstract> default). The default behaviour will leave
an undef as the bind variable, which may either create an empty string in the db or
give an error depending on your column type and db settings.

=item * C<duplicates> : For MySQL, define as C<'ignore'> or C<'update'> to get an
C<INSERT IGNORE> or C<ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE> query respectively. See L</"NOTES">
for details on the latter.

=item * C<oracle> : Will generate the Oracle C<INSERT ALL> syntax (required for
pre-23c Oracle Databases).

=back

=head2 multi_insert_sql

 my $sql = multi_insert_sql(
     $table,
     \@columns,      # names of table columns
     $num_of_rows?,  # default = 1
     $variant?       # can be set as 'ignore'/'update' on duplicate key (MySQL) or 'oracle'
 );

Builds bulk insert query (single insert is possible too), with ability for
ignore/on duplicate key update variants for MySQL.

Requires at least the name of the table C<$table> and an arrayref with the column
names C<\@columns>. See L</"NOTES"> if you want to quote table or column names.

Optional parameters:

=over 4
 
=item * C<$num_of_rows> : By default it returns SQL with bind value placeholders
for a single row. You can define any number of rows to use with multi-row bind
variable arrays.

=item * C<$variant> : For MySQL, passing C<'ignore'> as the 4th argument returns
an C<INSERT IGNORE> query. Passing C<'update'> as the argument returns a query
containing an `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause (see L</"NOTES"> for further details).
Passing C<'oracle'> will create the C<INSERT ALL> syntax for pre-23c Oracle DBs.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Using reserved words as object names

If you are using reserved words as table/column names (which is strongly discouraged),
just include the appropriate delimiter in the C<table> or C<cols> parameter. E.g. for
MySQL with columns named C<from> and C<to> you can do:

 cols => [qw/`from` `to`/]

For PostgreSQL or Oracle you'd do C<[qw/"from" "to"/]>, for SQL Server C<[qw/[from] [to]/]> etc.

=head2 On duplicate key update

The C<duplicates =E<gt> 'update'> option creates an C<ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE> clause
for the query. E.g.:

 my $sql = multi_insert_sql('table_name', [qw/col1 col2/], 2, 'update');

will produce:

 ## INSERT INTO table_name (col1,col2) VALUES (?,?),(?,?) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1=VALUES(col1),col2=VALUES(col2)

Note that as of MySQL 8.0.20 the C<VALUES> in C<UPDATE> is deprecated (row alias is
used instead), so this functionality might need to be updated some day if C<VALUES> is
removed completely.

=head2 Output whitespace

No spaces are added to the output string beyond the minimum. However, there is a new
line (C<\n>) added for each row of value placeholders - mainly to easily count the
number of rows from the string.
Also, the C<ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE> clause is on a new line.

=head2 Error handling

The module does not do any error handling on C<prepare>/C<execute> statements,
you should use L<DBI>'s C<RaiseError> and C<HandleErrror>.

=head2 Performance

The OO interface has minimal overhead. The only consideration is that if your rows
do not contain particularly large amounts of data, you may want to increase the buffer
size which is at a modest 100 rows.

Internally, to construct the prepared statements it uses similar logic to the public
functions. C<simple_insert> is of particular interest as it is a minimalistic function
that may replace (similar interface / feature set) the C<insert> functions from
C<SQL::Abstract> or C<SQL::Maker> while being over 40x faster than the former and
around 3x faster than the latter. The included C<bench/benchmark.pl> script gives
an idea (results on an M1 Pro Macbook):

 Compare SQL::Abstract, SQL::Maker, simple_insert:
                     Rate Abstract Abstract cached Maker Maker cached simple_insert
 Abstract          4207/s       --             -6%  -90%         -91%          -98%
